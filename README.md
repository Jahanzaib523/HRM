--------- Possible Obstacles -----------

 Occasionally, you will find the employee name that is supposed to be entered into the
respective field unavailable and only other ones available. If this poses a challenge, please
comment which name you selected as a backup for such cases (you can choose any other).
 In case of many iterations of testing you might find error messages indicating that the leave has
been entered already. The respective database entry can be deleted using provided
functionality on the page.
